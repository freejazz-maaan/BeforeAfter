Before/After Project


Before/After is a tool for retouching studios.

It is used to group images together, creating a slideshow of similarly named images. 

Retouching studios can use this to easily generate overview documents to send to clients, clearly illustrating the retouching work done. 



Before/After can make GIFs, or utilize a popular jquery library to create a JS faux-gif.
